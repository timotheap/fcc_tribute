								In the heart of Brussels, in a house Harry Potter and the like wouldn't have shunned, there is a private school that teaches the ancient techniques of decoration. Founded at the end of the XIX<sup>th</sup> century, this private school (Higher education) teaches marbling and woodgraining, murals, and other decorative techniques.<br>
								<br>
								The facade itself is a work of art. The late M. Van Der Kelen once painted every single brick, one by one, to obtain the beautiful patina of old baked bricks.<br>
								<br>
								The door and the windows are decorated, gilded dragons spit out volutes of iron, and it is only a prelued to what awaits the visitor.<br>
								<br>
								It is worth entering the school if only to have a glimpse of the work of art on the walls of the hall. Large marblings, painted by M. Van Der Kelen and his students a long time ago, spread the entire length of the hall. Visitors can only wish they had more time and space to take the measure of this masterpiece.<br>
								<br>
								Students vow to one day be able to paint like that, but marbling is a craft and it takes time and practice, and of course...talent.<br>
								<br>
								It was first intended for house painters who had little work in winter. This corresponded to a period a six months, the duration of the training. It hasn't changed, though few house painters now specialise in those techniques. Marbling and woodgraining is no longer a must-have in the tools of the painter. Instead, artists and other crafstmen have taken over and keep the tradition alive.

							<p>
								Over 40 hours a week, for six months. Marbling (Grand Antique, Portor, Sarrancolin, Jaune de Sienne,...) and Woodgraining (chestnut, oak, mahogany, pine,...), murals (mouldings, skies), patinas (bronze, terracotta,..)...But also perspective, drawing, preparation,...<br>
								<br>
								The training is intense, demanding. Students often stay up late in the night to finish their panels.<br>
								<br>
								All the material is included in the tuition: oil paint, linseed oil, paper, and brushes.<br>
								<br>
								The training is entirely based on observation followed by practice.<br>
								<br>
								Ms. Van Der Kelen teaches in English, French and Flemish.

								Traditional technique in oil paint.<br>
								<br>
								Oil paint is favoured for its infinite possibilities of transparency and fine layering.<br>
								<br>
								Students will learn how to prepare their own paint with linseed oil and pigments. Other decorative techniques for patinas include the use of beer.<br>
